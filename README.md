# Dual-Lock-System (In Progress)
This project is designed as a lock system for a door. To unlock the door completely, one must knock on the door. Once you knock, one of the locks will unlock. The display will then instruct you to put in the right passcode from a pool of three passwords, where the correct passcode of the day will be chosen at random, through a keypad. If the correct passcode is entered, the second lock unlocks, which unlocks the door completely. If an incorrect passcode is entered more than three times, the program will reset itself, and the procedure must be performed again.
